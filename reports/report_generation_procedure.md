# Report Creation / Generation Procedure

## Step 1: Edit report in a Markdown Editor
Recommended Editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Markdown Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown).

## Step 2: Save .md file to .html file
_Everything in this step is done within VS Code_

1. Install [Markdown All In One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) Extension.

2. In the window where you are editing the Markdown File, press `CMD` + `Shift` + `P`, and enter: 
    > Markdown All in One: Print current document to HTML

3. A `.html` file is generated within the same folder that the `.md` file is located.

## Step 3: Export .html to .pdf
Open the `.html` in the browser and print/export it as pdf. (You can customize page settings such as margin, header/footer etc.)
